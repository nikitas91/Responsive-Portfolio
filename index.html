                <p>Hi there! My name is Nikita Sasunkevich. I absolutely love programming and can't seem to stop learning everything
                    about it. It is something that grabbed my attention in high school and never seemed to leave my mind.
                    Ever since college graduation, I have been constantly thinking about the route I want to take professionally
                    in the massive world of programming. Quickly after graduation, I was able to stumble upon a web developer
                    position. Choosing the the career path of web development was probably the best choice I could've ever
                    made as I have been loving it ever since. I would say that my absolute favorite part of web development
                    is all of the different technologies and features we have at our disposal to create what we want and
                    how we want it!</p>

                <p>Alongside programming, I have many different passions as well. I am a total gearhead and love absolutely
                    everything about cars. The mechanics alone are mesmerizingly beautiful and give me nothing but absolute
                    joy. Hockey and football are my most favorite sports to play and watch. I have played hockey for nearly
                    13 years and have been watching football for as long as I can remember. </p>

                <p>Friends and family are the most important people in my life and I don't know where I would be without them!
                </p>
